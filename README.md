Paper Reading for Deep Learning
=======

This is a kind of dairy for my reading of paper/resource for AI especially on deep learning.

  * Transfer Learning
  * Basic Deep Learning
  * Deep Learning on devices

## Transfer Learning

   Particularly keen to understand more about transfer learning and so start on this.
   
 * [How transferable are features in deep neural networks?](paper/5347-how-transferable-are-features-in-deep-neural-networks.pdf)
* [Decaf A deep convolutional activation feature for generic visual recognition](paper/deep-convolutional-activation-feature-for-generic-visual-recognition.pdf)
* [How Deep Learning Work](paper/how_deep_learning_work.pdf)
* [Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision](inceptionv3.pdf)
* [Inception-V4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning](paper/inceptionv4.pdf)
* [CNN Feature Off-the-Shelf: an Astouding Baseline for Recognition](Razavian_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf)




## NLP

* [The amazing power of word vectors](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/)
