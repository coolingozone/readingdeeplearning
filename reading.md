This is a kind of dairy for my reading of paper/resource for AI especially on deep learning.

  * Transfer Learning
  * Basic Deep Learning
  * Deep Learning on devices

## Transfer Learning

   Particularly keen to understand more about transfer learning and so start on this.
   
 * [How transferable are features in deep neural networks?](5347-how-transferable-are-features-in-deep-neural-networks.pdf)

## NLP

* [The amazing power of word vectors](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/)
